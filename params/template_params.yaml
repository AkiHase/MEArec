# intracellular simulation settings
sim_time: 1 # intracellular simulation time in s
target_spikes: [3, 50]  # min-max number of spikes in sim_time
cut_out: [2, 5]  # pre-post peak cut_out in ms
dt: 0.03125  # time step (2**-5) in s
delay: 10  # stimulation delay in ms
weights: [0.25, 1.75]  # weights to multiply stimulus amplitude if number of spikes is above (0.25) or above (1.25)
